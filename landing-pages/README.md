# Landing pages

Standalone HTML landing pages built to sit as sub pages of
[pathwayprop.com.au](https://www.pathwayprop.com.au/) (Webflow site id
`64d063d22c0ee57d46bfca71`).

## Design tokens

Read from the live Webflow site so these pages match it rather than approximate it.

| Token | Value | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sand (page ground) | `#ECD4B3` | `Background 01` variable / `.body` background |
| Blanched almond | `#E5DCC9` | `Blanched Almond` variable |
| Card cream | `#F5F2EB` | `.article-card`, `.offering-card`, `.review-card` |
| Off-white | `#FAF8F5` | `Untitled UI Gray50` / `.navbar-container` |
| Midnight (ink + outlines) | `#090D2B` | `Midnight` variable |
| Body text | `rgba(9,13,43,.6)` | tag style on `p` |
| Pathway green | `#206E65` | `PATHWAY GREEN` variable |

## House rules the site follows

- **One typeface:** Plus Jakarta Sans, everywhere. `h1` 700 / tight negative
  tracking, `h2` 700, `h3` 600, body 16px / 1.7.
- **Outlines, not shadows:** almost every surface is a `1.5px solid #090D2B`
  border. The one shadow in use is the green cast
  `11px 22px 20px 0 rgba(32,110,101,.25)` (`.service-card`).
- **Big radii:** buttons, inputs and the navbar are fully round (`1000px`);
  cards are 30px or 50px; the footer slab is `100px 100px 0 0`.
- **Navbar:** fixed, 15px from the top, a floating off-white pill with a
  midnight outline — not a full-width sticky bar.
- **Buttons:** primary is green fill + midnight outline + white text;
  secondary is transparent + midnight outline. Both 14px/400, 300ms ease.
- **Footer:** Pathway green slab with rounded top corners, sitting on the sand.
